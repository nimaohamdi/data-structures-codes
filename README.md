## 🗂️ Structure

Each folder contains a C file that demonstrates a key data structure or algorithm.

### 1. `stacks/`
- **stack_array.c** – Stack implementation using arrays with push, pop, and peek operations.

### 2. `queues/`
- **queue_array.c** – Queue implementation using arrays with enqueue and dequeue operations.

### 3. `linked_lists/`
- **singly_linked_list.c** – Basic singly linked list with insertion at the end.

### 4. `sorting/`
- **bubble_sort.c** – Classic bubble sort algorithm for array sorting.

### 5. `searching/`
- **binary_search.c** – Binary search algorithm (iterative version).

### 6. `trees/`
- **binary_tree.c** – Binary tree with node creation and inorder traversal.

## 💡 How to Compile and Run

Each `.c` file is standalone. Use any C compiler (like `gcc`) to compile and run:

```bash
gcc file_name.c -o output
./output
